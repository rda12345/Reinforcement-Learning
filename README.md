# Reinforcement Learning

The repository contains various RL algorithms and solved problems, based on the OpenAI Gymnasium module.
Many of the files follow Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction][https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf], and David Silver's [online course][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ].
