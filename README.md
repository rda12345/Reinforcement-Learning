# Reinforcement Learning

The repository contains various RL algorithms and solved problems, based on the OpenAI Gymnasium module.
Many of the files follow Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction", and David Silver's lectures on youtube. 

## Files

  q_learning: contains the Q-learning method
  
  DPAgent: contains the dynamic programming methods, policy
            iteration and value iteration algorithms.
  
  Taxi-v3: GridWorld environment solved by both policy iteration and value iteration.
  
  FrozenLake-v1: GridWorld environment solved by Q-learning.
